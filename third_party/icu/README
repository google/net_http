ICU currently does not have public BUILD files for Bazel, so we've created
our own based upon the currently downloaded version of Bazel. This BUILD
is similar to the one used in TensorFlow and TF Text.

TensorFlow and TF Text also patch Bazel to include data files necessary
which are not a part of the core release, but are built into the code. This
patch file is a combination of the two. Below are the steps to generate:
1.  Checkout ICU and update to the correct version.
    `cd /tmp`
    `git clone https://github.com/unicode-org/icu.git`
    `git checkout release-64-2`
2.  Apply TF Text patch.
    `cp third_party/tensorflow_text/oss_scripts/third_party/icu/udata.patch.oss /tmp/icu`
    `patch -p1 < udata.patch.oss`
3.  Copy the files and stash the changes.
    `git status`
    `cp icu4c/source/common/udata.cpp ..`
    `cp icu4c/source/common/unicode/uconfig.h ..`
    `git stash`
4.  Apply TF patch.
    `cp third_party/tensorflow/third_party/icu/udata.patch.oss /tmp/icu`
    `patch -p1 < udate.patch.oss`
5.  Combine changes.
    `git add . && git commit -m .`
    `git stash pop`
    < resolve differences with vim >
    `git add .`
    `git reset HEAD^`
6.  Generate new patch file.
    `git diff > icu.data.patch`
